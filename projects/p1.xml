<title>The interpretation of disjunction in negative sentences</title>

<text>
    <p>This line of investigation studies how children and adults interpret disjunction in negative contexts 
    across different languages. As for linguistic theory, the results offer empirical evidence to the 
    cross-linguistic distinction between PPI and non-PPI, but at the same time rise new questions, 
    such as the role of prosody in assigning interpretation to potentially ambiguous sentences. 
    As for language acquisition, the investigations of childrenâ€™s understanding of disjunction under negation 
    in different languages reached the conclusion that children start by preferring the subset of the truth-conditions 
    assigned to the negated disjunction according to classical logic, independently from the interpretation assigned 
    by adult speakers of the local language. This pattern of responses has been explained in terms of a principle of 
    language learnability called Semantic Subset Principle (Crain et al., 1994). However, it emerges that others factors 
    are at play such as the presence of alternative forms for disjunction and the language-specific particularities of 
    the syntax and semantics of negation.

<p>Developmental Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by specific difficulty in learning 
to read accurately and fluently. It has been argued that the source of the disorder in developmental 
dyslexia is phonological in nature. However, dyslexics often suffer from for fine and gross motor problems, 
subtle deficits in the processing of morphosyntactic features and of complex syntactic structures, 
and experience difficulties in rhythm perception. This project aims at defining a 
more-fine grained linguistic and cognitive profile of children with Developmental Dyslexia. </p>

<title>Scalar implicature in first language acquisition</title>

<text>
<p>Children accept a sentence such as 'Some giraffes wear a scarf' in a context in which all 
giraffes are wearing a scarf â€“ differently from adults who would reject such a sentence in that context. 
So, for an adult, 'some' means 'not all', even if logically speaking 'all' asymmetrically entails 'some'. 
This line of investigation focuses on how children derive this type of inferences - which are usually called scalar implicature -  
and on their variable success in computing them. </p>

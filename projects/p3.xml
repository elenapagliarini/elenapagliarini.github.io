<p>A fundamental power of human language is the capacity to refer to quantities of entities,
as expressed by quantifiers, numerical and plural expressions. This project investigates how 
children interpret sentences with semantically plural arguments, such as the quantifier each and every. 
Previous acquisition research showed that pre-schoolers assign non-adult-like interpretations to all 
and each and that the acquisition of quantification is a lengthy process. 
However, the source of the difficulty with quantifiers such as each and every is still unknown and a 
unifying account has not been proposed yet.

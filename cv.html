        <p> Since September 2019 I am an Assistant Professor at the Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Padova, after being a Marie Sklodowska-Curie research fellow for the project 'PredictAble' at the Center for Brain and Cognition (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) and a postdoc with Prof. Adriana Belletti at the University of Siena. In addition, I had three funded visiting periods in international research centers: 15 months at Macquarie University (Sydney); 7 months at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and 1 month at the Universitat Auton&oacute;ma de Barcelona. I obtained my PhD in 2016 from the Universiy of Milano-Bicocca with a dissertation on the linguistic and cognitive profiles of children with dyslexia supervised by Prof. Maria Teresa Guasti. </p>
        <p> My research predominantly focuses on language acquisition and is mainly experimental, so besides having a thorough grasp of the field of language acquisition and its outstanding questions, I have an up-to-date knowledge of experimental design and analysis.</p>
        <p>My profile has been enriched by many international stays in prestigious universities in Australia, Germany, Spain and Italy allowing me to build a strong international network and to develop original and critical thought. Throughout my career, I obtained several grants and awards to finance my research projects. </p>
        <p>My work lies at the intersection between linguistics and cognitive science. I lead two main productive research lines: (i) the acquisition of logical operators with a cross-linguistic edge; (ii) the linguistic and extra-linguistic profiles of children with dyslexia and language impairment. These two topics are apparently disconnected &mdash;but both shed light on the complex and fascinating processes involved in the acquisition of language.</p>
